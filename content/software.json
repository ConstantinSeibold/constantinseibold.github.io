We show that this is useful in typical image-to-image translations allowing us to successfully drive the generator without relying on additional networks. We demonstrate this on many difficult image translation problems such as image-to-image domain mapping, single image super-resolution and photo realistic makeup transfer.",

          "short_description": "Unstructured data in industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing presents significant challenges for efficient analysis and decision making. Detecting patterns within this data and understanding their impact is critical but complex without the right tools. Traditionally, these tasks relied on the expertise of data analysts or labor-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker, an interactive tool designed to explore and annotate data across multiple modalities. Spacewalker allows users to extract data representations and visualize them in low-dimensional spaces, enabling the detection of semantic similarities. Through extensive user studies, we assess Spacewalker's effectiveness in data annotation and integrity verification. Results show that the tool's ability to traverse latent spaces and perform multi-modal queries significantly enhances the user's capacity to quickly identify relevant data. Moreover, Spacewalker allows for annotation speed-ups far superior to conventional methods, making it a promising tool for efficiently navigating unstructured data and improving decision making processes.
