    "description": "In our group \"Computer Vision in Medicine\", we tackle a variety of problems relating to the automated analysis of visual information in the clinical setting. This ranges across different fields of medical imaging from PET-CT scans over radiological data to photo-based imaging. We investigate ways how we can provide essential information to medical staff in the most efficient manner to streamline the clinical workflow.",
